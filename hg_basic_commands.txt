# USING MERCURIAL (hg)

1) Cloning initial repository
hg clone https://model@bitbucket.org/model/model ./MODEL

2) Changing working branch
hg update ‘name of branch’

3) Committing and pushing changes:
cd MODEL
(make local changes)
hg addremove
hg commit -m ‘some description’
hg push 

4) Creating named branch
hg branch BranchName

5) Merging branches. For example merging B into A, keeping conflicting files from B:
hg update A
hg merge B --tool internal:other
hg commit -m "Merged B into A”
hg checkout B
hg commit --close-branch -m ‘Feature done, merging into A branch’

6) Find large files in repository
hg files "set:size('>1M')"

7) Revert to a specific changeset
hg log
hg update <changeset number>

8) Updating local repository
hg pull
hg update
(this is to force remote files) hg update --clean
